# Use cases

## Manage a band

Tina plays the bass in a band and tries hard to organize the songs they play.
With Zitiket she can:

* tag songs that the band knows how to play
* tag songs that the band knows how to play
* tag songs that will be played at the rehearsals at a precise date, in the order they will be played
* tag songs that will be played at the show at a precise date, in the order they will be played
* browse users who can play all the songs of the band
* browse users who can play the songs of the band that will be played at a precise show

## Music tastes

* I know this
* I can listen to this
* I like to listen to this
* I love to listen to this

## Learn music

* browse the songs which only contain mastered harmony tricks
* list of harmony concepts or tricks
* parts of songs (verse, chorus, pre-chorus, bridge…)
* harmony concepts or tricks are attached to chapters of the book, so we can
  compute things like : « 80% of the user, if ever they read half of the book,
  could understand more than 80% of the songs they like or love ».

## User vs official tags

* *Genre* tags are not Zitiket's main concern but users we be able to create
  their own tags.
